abstract = {Bi-stable response of cross-ply composites is modelled when snap processes are trigged by a vertical force and the laminate is supported at four points. The model is based on the Rayleigh–Ritz technique. Non-linear von K\'{a}rm\'{a}n strains, non-uniform curvatures and uniform through-the-thickness normal strain are included in the analysis. The analysis has been carried out step by step, by small increments of the applied load. Experiments in four [0/90]T carbon/epoxy laminates have been carried out for comparison in a test configuration that fulfils the requirements of the model. The multi-event snap-through and intermediate equilibrium positions have been experimentally observed and recorded. The initial snap-through and snap-back load–displacement curves have been experimentally determined and compared to those corresponding to the proposed model.},

        abstract = {Models to describe the shapes of unsymmetric laminates produced with a flat mould have been already developed by several researchers. These models are reviewed and on some points theory is extended.  The experimental work done so far to confirm the developed theoretical models is rather limited. This especially applies for angle-ply laminates, on which no experimental work has been reported yet. This paper presents new experimental work that has been conducted both on cross-ply and angle-ply laminates over a wide range of laminate dimensions. The experiments show that the influence of the side length on the curvature is very well predicted both for cross-ply and angle-ply laminates, also the bifurcation point behaviour is clearly observed. Possible causes of differences between theory and experiment are outlined. The theoretical predictions are especially sensitive to the transverse thermal expansion coefficient of the individual layers}

	abstract = {The loads on wind turbine components are primarily from the blades. It is important to control these loads in order to avoid damaging the wind turbine. Rotor control technology is currently limited to controlling the rotor speed and the blade pitch. As blades increase in length, it becomes less desirable to pitch the entire blade as a single rigid body, but there is a requirement to control loads more precisely along the length of the blade. This can be achieved with aerodynamic control devices such as flaps. Morphing structures are good candidates for wind turbine flaps because they have the potential to create structures that have the conflicting abilities of being load carrying, lightweight and shape adaptive. A morphing flap design with an anisotropic cellular structure is presented, which is able to undergo large deflections and high strains. An aeroelastic analysis couples the work done by aerodynamic loads on the flap, the flap strain energy and the required actuation work to change shape. The morphing flap model is manufactured, and its stiffness is measured},

Dependent on the laminate lay-up, these inhomogeneous residual stresses, which are primarily caused by thermal effects, moisture absorption and chemical shrinkage, can lead to large multistable out-of-plane deformations in the case of unsymmetric laminates. Instead of avoiding these laminate's curvatures, they can be advantageously used for technical applications such as novel adaptive structures. In order to adjust the laminate deformations to technical requirements, a dimensioning tool based on a modified stability analysis in combination with a novel optimisation procedure has been developed and experimentally verified. Based on the theoretical investigations, an adaptive prototype of a multistable composite with integrated smart alloys has been designed and manufactured.},

	abstract = {An approximate solution is given for the postbuckling of infinitely long and unsymmetrically laminated composite plates. This solution is obtained by superposing a polynomial transverse displacement given by bending due to unsymmetric laminate configurations and a simple functional representation for the buckling mode in conjunction with the Galerkin method. Nondimensional parameters are used to express the approximate solution in a very simple and clear formulation. The results given by this solution for axial compression in the longitudinal direction are compared with the results given by the nonlinear finite element method (FEM) for finite length rectangular long plates. The influence of the boundary conditions on postbuckling response is also studied. For the FEM analysis, two different simply supported boundary conditions on the long edges of the plate are considered. It is found that these two sets of boundary conditions give different results for the buckling and postbuckling finite element analysis. In most cases the FEM analysis overestimate and, respectively, underestimate the approximate closed form solution, depending on the type of simply supported boundary condition considered. Thus, the approximate solution appears useful for design purposes as an averaged quantity between the two FEM analyses. Also, it is found that the reduced bending stiffness method can be successfully used for determining the approximate solution. ?? 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Composite shells show a rich multistable behaviour of interest for the design of shape-changing (morphing) structures. Previous studies have investigated how the initial shape determines the shell stability properties. For uniform initial curvatures and orthotropic material behaviour, not more than two stable equilibria have been reported. In this paper, we prove that untwisted, uniformly curved, thin orthotropic shells can have up to three stable equilibrium configurations. Cases of tristability are first documented using a numerical stability analysis of an extensible shallow shell model. Including mid-plane extension shows that the shells must be sufficiently curved in relation to their thickness to be multistable. Thus, an inextensible model allows us to perform an analytical stability analysis. Focusing on untwisted initial configurations, we illustrate with simple analytical results how the material parameters of the shell control the dependence of its multistable behaviour on the initial curvatures. In particular, we show that when the bending stiffness matrix approaches a degeneracy condition, the shell exhibits three stable equilibria for a wide range of initial curvatures.},

Continuum versions are often elastic composite plates or shells, such as the common measuring tape or the slap bracelet, both of which exhibit two stable configurations: rolled and unrolled. Here we consider the energy landscape of a general class of multistable anisotropic strips with spontaneous Gaussian curvature. We show that while strips with non-zero Gaussian curvature can be bistable, strips with positive spontaneous curvature are always bistable, independent of the elastic moduli, strips of spontaneous negative curvature are bistable only in the presence of spontaneous twist and when certain conditions on the relative stiffness of the strip in tension and shear are satisfied. Furthermore, anisotropic strips can become tristable when their bending rigidity is small. Our study synthesizes and generalizes the theory of multistability in anisotropic shells and suggests new design criteria for these structures.},

	abstract = {Inducing an initial curvature is advantageous for tailoring the curvature of bistable Carbon Fiber Reinforced Prepreg (CFRP) laminate because the final curvature of the laminate can be tailored without changing its mechanical properties, i.e., bending rigidity, thickness, and weight. However, curvature tailoring with initial curvature has been limited to tailoring the curvature of only one state of the two equilibrium states. In this study, we propose a curvature tailoring scheme which can tailor the curvatures of both equilibrium states by misaligning the laminate and the cylindrical tool-plate for curing. This method was verified by analysis with the Rayleigh–Ritz method and experiments. In addition, explicit equations to determine the misalignment angle and tool-plate curvature are derived for curvature tailoring of the bistable CFRP cross-ply laminates. These equations provide a simple engineering guideline for designers of bistable CFRP cross-ply laminate. The proposed curvature tailoring method gives the designer the ability to select the curvature of both equilibrium states without changing its mechanical properties, and increasing the functionality of bistable CFRP laminates.},

	abstract = {Under certain conditions asymmetric composite laminates can have a bistable response to mechanical loading. A transition between the two stable states provides opportunities to produce large deflections or shape changes from relatively low energy inputs that do not need to be maintained to sustain a specific shape. Such laminates are attracting interest in aerospace applications, deployable structures and energy harvesting. Accurate modelling predictions of bistable laminate shapes has proven challenging, in part due to uncertainties in geometry, material properties and the operating environment of the laminates. In this paper a detailed sensitivity analysis of the influence of each of these properties on laminate curvature is undertaken and demonstrates that bistable laminates are most sensitive to uncertainties in the Young's moduli, thermal expansion coefficients, ply thickness and the temperature change from the elevated cure temperature. Accurate characterisation of these properties and quality control during manufacture can reduce the discrepancies between analytical models and experimental results and allow the models to be used as viable tools for the design of bistable laminates. It is also shown that laminates are highly sensitive to moisture absorption and temperature changes, especially when changes in material properties due to temperature were included in the modelling. ?? 2013 Elsevier Ltd.},

A theoretical model is developed using the Rayleigh-Ritz principle to predict the effect of piezoelectric layer on laminated shell deformation. Several stacking sequences are investigated. Owing to the curvature of the shell, the position of the piezoelectric layer has a great effect on the deformation. The effect of the P-layer as the outer surface or inner surface is investigated. It is found that to achieve the same amount of deformation, different levels of electric fields have to be applied depending on the P-layer configuration. The efficiency of the P-layer on shells with various stacking sequences is also studied and it is observed that the efficiency is determined by the stacking sequence of the composite layers.

Continuum versions are often elastic composite plates or shells, such as the common measuring tape or the slap bracelet, both of which exhibit two stable configurations: rolled and unrolled. Here, we consider the energy landscape of a general class of multi-stable anisotropic strips with spontaneous Gaussian curvature. We show that while strips with non-zero Gaussian curvature can be bistable, and strips with positive spontaneous curvature are always bistable, independent of the elastic moduli, strips of spontaneous negative curvature are bistable only in the presence of spontaneous twist and when certain conditions on the relative stiffness of the strip in tension and shear are satisfied. Furthermore, anisotropic strips can become tristable when their bending rigidity is small. Our study complements and extends the theory of multi-stability in anisotropic shells and suggests new design criteria for these structures.},

abstract ={Distributed compliance systems with integrated variable stiffness elements show great promise for reconciling the conflicting requirements of morphing. The distinct structural properties of each equilibrium configuration allow bi-stable laminates to provide stiffness variability in a purely elastic, energy-efficient manner. This article presents a novel morphing concept based on a distributed arrangement of embeddable variable stiffness bi-stable composites inside a 500 mm chord NACA 0012 profile (where ‘NACA’ is the National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics). The structural response of the aerofoil is assessed numerically and experimentally, with a particular focus on the global stiffness modification potential via the snap-through of the component laminates. Extending the validated finite element models to include a weak static aeroelastic coupling permits evaluation of the aerodynamic adequacy of the final, passively morphed shapes. This concurrent aero-structural methodology is finally employed to develop an improved design. The results allow for assessing the feasibility and potential of the innovative morphing approach exploiting selective compliance provided by the stiffness variability of the integrated bi-stable elements.},

abstract ={The room-temperature shapes of cured unsymmetric composite laminates have out-of-plane warping after autoclave processing. In addition, they exhibit two stable room-temperature configurations due to snap-through phenomena when the side length of laminates exceed a critical value. The cured shape of unsymmetric laminates are influenced by many factors. Experiments show that the effect of tool-plate cannot be ignored and has significant influence on the cured shape.This study examines slippage effects resulting from the interaction between the laminates and the tool-plate which are ignored in the previous researches. By introducing a dimensionless slippage coefficient and correlating the corresponding value with experimental results, the influence of processing parameters is investigated. Modeling is extended to predict curvatures of general lamination layup configurations.},

volume = {14},

pages = {795-814}, 
year = {2003}, 
abstract ={The paper discusses the concept of using a piezoceramic actuator bonded         to one side of a two-layer unsymmetric cross ply [0/90]        T        laminate to provide the moments necessary to snap the laminate from one         stable equilibrium shape to another. The results presented are considered         an alternative to existing morphing concepts wherein actuators are used         to elastically warp structures into a shape other than their natural and         unique equilibrium shape. These existing concepts require the continuous         application of power to maintain the warped shape. With the concept discussed         here, the actuators are used only to change from one equilibrium shape         to another, so continuous power is not needed. The paper discusses several         phases of modeling, including bonding the actuator to the laminate and         applying voltage to the actuator to effect the shape change, and experimental         work. Two models are developed, a simple model and a more refined one.         Both are based on the Rayleigh-Ritz technique and the use of energy and         variational methods. The experimental phase of the study is discussed,         particularly the measurement of the voltage level needed to snap the laminate.         The voltage measurements are compared with predictions and the agreement         between measurements and the predictions of the refined model are reasonable,         both qualitatively and quantitatively. Suggestions for future activities         are presented.},

Many unsymmetric laminates have more than one stable room-temperature shape and can be snapped through from one stable shape to another. In this new concept for morphing structures, one or more piezoelectric actuators are bonded to unsymmetric laminates, and are then used to snap the laminate from one shape to another. The actuator would be used to change shape, but would not be required to maintain the shape. Using the Rayleigh-Ritz technique, several models are developed to predict the interaction between the base laminate and the actuator. In particular, the voltage (applied to the actuator) needed to snap the laminate is predicted. The NASA-LaRC Macro- Fiber Composite (MFC) actuator is chosen as the actuator of choice for this work. A laminate is manufactured, an actuator is bonded to the laminate, and experiments are performed. Since the agreement between the initial models and experimental results was not good, the models were revised. Good agreement between the predictions of the revised model and experiment is reached.

@article{Schultz2007,
	abstract = {A novel type of morphing structure capable of a large change in shape with a small energy input is discussed in this paper. The considered structures consist of two curved shells that are joined in a specific manner to form a bistable airfoil-like structure. The two stable shapes have a difference in axial twist, and the structure may be transformed between the stable shapes by a simple snap-through action. The benefit of a bistable structure of this type is that, if the stable shapes are operational shapes, power is needed only to transform the structure from one shape to another. The discussed structures could be used in aerodynamic applications such as morphing wings, or as aerodynamic control surfaces. The investigation discussed in this paper considers both experiment and finite-element analysis. Several graphite-epoxy composite and one steel device were created as proof-of-concept models. To demonstrate active control of these structures, piezocomposite actuators were applied to one of the composite structures and used to transform the structure between stable shapes. The analysis was used to compare the predicted shapes with the experimental shapes, and to study how changes to the geometric input values affected the shape and operational characteristics of the structures. The predicted shapes showed excellent agreement with the experimental shapes, and the results of the parametric study suggest that the shapes and the snap-through characteristics can be easily tailored to meet specific needs.},

abstract ={This article presents the derivation and validation of a low order model for the non-linear dynamics of cross-ply bi-stable composite plates focusing on the response of one stable state. The Rayleigh–Ritz method is used to solve the associated linear problem to obtain valuable theoretical insight into how to formulate an approximate non-linear dynamic model. This allows us to follow a Galerkin approach projecting the solution of the non-linear problem onto the mode shapes of the linear problem. The order of the non-linear model is reduced using theoretical results from the linear solution yielding a low order model. The dynamic response of a bi-stable plate specimen is studied to simplify the model further by only keeping the non-linear terms leading to observed oscillations. Simulations for the dynamic response using the derived model are presented showing excellent agreement with the experimentally observed behaviour. Additionally, deflection shapes are measured and compared with the calculated mode shapes, showing good agreement.},

abstract ={Broad-scale area change of a non-porous surface while maintaining resistance to aerodynamic loading was demonstrated through the development of a passive elastomeric matrix composite morphing skin. The combined system includes an elastomer-fiber-composite surface layer that is supported by a flexible honeycomb structure, each of which exhibit a near-zero in-plane Poisson’s ratio. A number of elastomers, composite arrangements, and substructure configurations were evaluated and characterization testing led to the selection of the most appropriate components for prototype development. The complete prototype morphing skin demonstrated 100% uniaxial extension accompanied by a 100% increase in surface area. Results from out-of-plane pressure loading showed that out-of-plane deflection of less than 0.1 in. (2.5 mm) can be maintained at various levels of area change under pressures of up to 200 psf (9.58 kPa). Applications to wing span morphing UAVs are also discussed.},

	volume={19},
	number={12},
	pages={124010},
	year={2010},
	abstract={One of the possibilities for the next generation of smart high-lift devices is to use a seamless morphing structure. A passive composite variable-stiffness skin as a solution to the dilemma of designing the structure to have high enough stiffness to withstand aerodynamic loading and low stiffness to enable morphing is proposed. The variable-stiffness skin is achieved by allowing for a spatial fibre angle and skin thickness variation on a morphing high-lift system. The stiffness distribution is tailored to influence the deformation of the structure beneficially. To design a realistic stiffness distribution, it is important to take aerodynamic and actuation loads into account during the optimization. A two-dimensional aero-servo-elastic framework is created for this purpose. Skin optimization is performed using a gradient-based optimizer, where sensitivity information is found through application of the adjoint method. The implementation of the aero-servo-elastic environment is addressed and initial optimization results presented. The results indicate that a variable-stiffness skin increases the design space. Moreover, the importance of taking the change in aerodynamic loads due to morphing skin deformation into account during optimization is demonstrated.}
